You are given an array of k linked-lists lists, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
Explanation: The linked-lists are:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
merging them into one sorted list:
1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []

Solution  Compare one by one and Optimize with a Priority Queue

Compare every node (head of every linked list) and get the node with the smallest value.
Extend the final sorted linked list with the selected nodes.

Space complexity: 
O(1)

Time complexity: 
O(kN) where k is the number of linked lists.
